# ORT Mobile Pre-Built Package Operator and Type Support

These are the operators and types included in the ORT Mobile pre-built packages for each release. Supported operators and types selected are based on what is required to support float32 and quantized versions of popular models. The full list of input models used to determine this list is available [here](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/v1.17.3/tools/ci_build/github/android/mobile_package.required_operators.readme.txt).
