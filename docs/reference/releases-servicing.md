# ONNX Runtime releases

The current ONNX Runtime release is [1.18](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/releases/tag/v1.18.0).

The next release is ONNX Runtime release 1.19.

Official releases of ONNX Runtime are managed by the core ONNX Runtime team. A new release is published approximately every quarter, and the upcoming roadmap can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/wiki/Upcoming-Release-Roadmap).

Releases are versioned according to [Versioning](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/main/docs/Versioning.md) and release branches are prefixed with "rel-". Patch releases may be published periodically between full releases and have their own release branch.

ONNX Runtime releases commit to backwards compatibility. To report a regression, please [file a Github issue](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/new/choose).
